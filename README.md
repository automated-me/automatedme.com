blakes.ws
=========

Website project and distribution for blakes.ws

The site is hosted as github pages.  The project uses yeomen, grunt, and bower. The site itself uses polymer.

##deploying
The site is contained on the gh-pages branch and found in the dist directory. Deployment is handled by a handy script
I found (and checked in at the root) - https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy

`./deploy -s` will push the dist folder up the github as the new site
